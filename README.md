# SYSC4907-Training

This repository contains the datasets and jupyter notebook files for the transformer model training for the 2020-2021 COVID-19 Social Media Data Analytics using Deep Learning project.

The notebook files were originally composed in Google Colab, thus data loading will require modification to run locally. Filepaths will also need to be changed to fit your environment.

model_training_base is the base implementation of the transformer, achieving 63-64% accuracy.

bert_model_training (WIP) is the work in progress BERT model that was not finalized. As covered in the report, an unknown issue caused constant label prediction, and as a result of debugging and troubleshooting the notebook is messy and includes several redundant sections.
